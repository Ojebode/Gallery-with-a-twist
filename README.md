# Gallery-with-a-twist
Created this Gallery for fun for my girl friend for Valentine. 
Intitally created the first version with Eclipse. This is the updated version edited with Android studio
Basically, the app takes some of my pictures girl friend in the image resource folder and a love song as input and includes a next and 
previous button to navigate and loop through the images. The song plays in background on launch of the application.
